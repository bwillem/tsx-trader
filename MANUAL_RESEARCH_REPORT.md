## Conclusion

**Manual research is valuable but limited**. We found 2 potential candidates:

1. **Savaria (SIS.TO)** - Industrial/healthcare play, profitable, growing, but need FCF data
2. **Docebo (DCBO.TO)** - SaaS with excellent returns, but growth slowing

**To build a full 20-25 stock portfolio**, we need:
- Automated data provider (Alpha Vantage, Financial Modeling Prep, or yfinance)
- Cash flow and balance sheet data
- Ability to screen hundreds of stocks efficiently

**Recommendation**:
1. Test Alpha Vantage with these 2 stocks
2. If it works → proceed with batching approach
3. If not → switch to Financial Modeling Prep ($15/month) or yfinance (free)

Manual research confirms our strategies are sound, but we need scale to find enough candidates for diversification.
